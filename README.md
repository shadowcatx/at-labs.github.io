This is the github.io page for ATLabs.

#Blogging
New posts should go into `_posts`, and the associcated images go to `blog/img`.

#Local development
The site is generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). To run a local server:

```
$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll serve
```

You can then connect to the server at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
